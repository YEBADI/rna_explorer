# RNA explorer

**RNA Explorer** (RNA-E) is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosted web application, designed for quick and easy analysis of raw bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Users can upload a CSV file containing raw  gene expression counts data and RNA-E will quickly produce useful detailed tables and visualizations. As RNA-E is hosted on AWS, RNA-E is scalable, secure and efficient.

## Features

- **CSV File Upload:** Upload raw bulk RNA-seq data in CSV format.
- **Data Table:** View processed gene expression data in easy to use tables.
- **Data Visualization:** Plot nice and clear graphs to explore gene expression.
- **AWS Integration:** RNA-E leverages AWS for storage, computation, and deployment to provide a robust and scalable web app solution.
- **User Authentication:** RNA-E has integrity - with a secure login system to protect data and maintain privacy.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React
